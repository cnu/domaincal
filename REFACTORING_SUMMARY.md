# DomainCal Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The DomainCal application has been refactored to follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern. This refactoring improves code organization, maintainability, and scalability by separating concerns and creating a more structured codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created MVC Directory Structure

- Added `/src/models` for data structures
- Added `/src/controllers` for request handling
- Added `/src/services` for business logic

### 2. Implemented Models

- Created `domain.model.ts` for domain-related data structures
- Created `user.model.ts` for user-related data structures
- Moved type definitions and serialization functions to appropriate model files

### 3. Implemented Services

- Created `domain.service.ts` for domain operations
- Created `auth.service.ts` for authentication operations
- Created `pending-domains.service.ts` for managing pending domains
- Created `domain-lookup.service.ts` for domain information lookup

### 4. Implemented Controllers

- Created `domain.controller.ts` for handling domain-related requests
- Created `auth.controller.ts` for handling authentication-related requests

### 5. Updated API Routes

- Refactored `/api/domains` to use the domain controller
- Refactored `/api/auth/register` to use the auth controller
- Updated route handlers to delegate to controllers

### 6. Updated Frontend Components

- Updated `pending-domains-handler.tsx` to use the new service structure
- Updated auth-related code to work with the refactored backend

### 7. Added Documentation

- Created `MVC_ARCHITECTURE.md` to document the new architecture
- Created this summary document to explain the changes

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Improved Code Organization**: Code is now organized by function rather than by file type
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a specific responsibility
3. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Easier to understand, modify, and extend the codebase
4. **Better Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
5. **Reduced Duplication**: Common functionality is now centralized in services
6. **Clearer API Structure**: API endpoints now follow a consistent pattern

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Add unit tests for models, services, and controllers
2. **Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling throughout the application
3. **Validation**: Add input validation middleware
4. **Documentation**: Add API documentation for endpoints
5. **Optimization**: Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks

## How to Work with the New Structure

When adding new features or making changes:

1. **Models**: Define data structures and serialization functions
2. **Services**: Implement business logic and database interactions
3. **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses
4. **Routes**: Define API endpoints that delegate to controllers
5. **Frontend**: Update components to interact with the API

This structure makes it easier to understand where changes should be made and how components interact with each other.
